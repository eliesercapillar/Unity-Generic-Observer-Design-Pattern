# Unity Generic Observer Design Pattern
This project contains boilerplate code that can be expanded upon whenever using the [_Observer Design Pattern_][ObserverDP] in new Unity Projects. This generic observer uses UnityEvents instead of delegates.

This script was made with the help of Adam Myhre's amazingly informative youtube channel, [_git-amend_][Youtube]. If you haven't already seen it, definitely check out [_Adam's GitHub!_][GH]!
This repository is for my convenience and I will modify this script to fit my use cases specifically.
